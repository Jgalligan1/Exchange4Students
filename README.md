# Exchange4Students

Exchange4Students is a campus item exchange platform for Stevens students. The application allows students to post items for sale, search and add items to their cart, and complete an orderâ€”all while enabling sellers to edit or delete their listings. Future enhancements include full user account management with signup/login, robust checkout processes, and improved error handling.
